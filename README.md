# Analyzing-American-Baby-Name-Trends
Use categorization and ranking techniques to explore 101 years of American baby name tastes.

Project Description:

What makes a name timeless or trendy? In this project, we will use data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration spanning over a hundred years to understand American baby name tastes.

The ranking, grouping, joining, ordering, and pattern-matching skills we will use in this project are broadly applicable: understanding changing tastes is a key competency for businesses as well as parents searching for a baby name!

Project Tasks:

1. Classic American names
2. Timeless or trendy?
3. Top-ranked female names since 1920
4. Picking a baby name
5. The Olivia expansion
6. Many males with the same name
7. Top male names over the years
8. The most years at number one
